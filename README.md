# PROJECT LAYOUT

GenerationProcess:
1. Run `polymer init custom-build`
2. Elsewhere run `feathers generate app`
3. Manually merge over relevant details from the feathers app.

```
- bower_components
- build  // polymer-build output a directory of static assets, including polymer fragments, js and images
    - bundled // Traditional - optimized and concatenated
    - unbundled // Optimized and unconcatenated for high cacheability, lazy loading and ready for HTTP/2 Server Push. Must be served up as static assets through Feathers for netjet to work.
- config // Feathers configuration
    - default.json
    - production.json
- data // Default local DB for Feathers. Typically removed for remote DB like Mongo or Postgres
- gulp-tasks // Build tasks as created by `generator-polymer-init-custom-build`
- images // Polymer created images folder. Gets processed by the build
- node_modules
    - netjet // Adds HTTP/2 Link headers to returned HTML specifically for use by Cloudflare, enabling Server Push.
- public // Polymer fragments. Created by `polymer init` as `src` and renamed to avoid Feathers collisions. polymer.json must be updated.
- src // Feathers application code
- test // Polymer and Feathers tests merged
    - fragments // Polymer fragments tests. 
    - services  // Feathers tests
    - etc...
- .gitignore    // Polymer and Feathers ignores merged
- .jshintrc     // From Feathers
- .npmignore    // From Feathers
- bower.json    // From Polymer
- gulpfile.js   // `generator-polymer-init-custom-build` generated build script.
- index.html    // Top level Polymer entry point. Static asset. Highly cacheable. Rarely changed.
- manifest.json // Polymer generated mobile web manifest 
- package.json  // Merged from Polymer and Feathers
- README.md
- service-worker.js // Generated by Polymer
- sw-precache-config.js // Generated by Polymer
```

## Merging test directories
## Merging package.json
## .gitignore merged
## Clarify the build/unbundled folder. How/why served.

# Polymer App Toolbox - Starter Kit

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/PolymerElements/polymer-starter-kit.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/PolymerElements/polymer-starter-kit)

This template is a starting point for building apps using a drawer-based
layout. The layout is provided by `app-layout` elements.

This template, along with the `polymer-cli` toolchain, also demonstrates use
of the "PRPL pattern" This pattern allows fast first delivery and interaction with
the content at the initial route requested by the user, along with fast subsequent
navigation by pre-caching the remaining components required by the app and
progressively loading them on-demand as the user navigates through the app.

The PRPL pattern, in a nutshell:

* **Push** components required for the initial route
* **Render** initial route ASAP
* **Pre-cache** components for remaining routes
* **Lazy-load** and progressively upgrade next routes on-demand

### Setup

##### Prerequisites

Install [polymer-cli](https://github.com/Polymer/polymer-cli):

    npm install -g polymer-cli

##### Initialize project from template

    mkdir my-app
    cd my-app
    polymer init starter-kit

### Start the development server

This command serves the app at `http://localhost:8080` and provides basic URL
routing for the app:

    polymer serve --open


### Build

This command performs HTML, CSS, and JS minification on the application
dependencies, and generates a service-worker.js file with code to pre-cache the
dependencies based on the entrypoint and fragments specified in `polymer.json`.
The minified files are output to the `build/unbundled` folder, and are suitable
for serving from a HTTP/2+Push compatible server.

In addition the command also creates a fallback `build/bundled` folder,
generated using fragment bundling, suitable for serving from non
H2/push-compatible servers or to clients that do not support H2/Push.

### Preview the build

This command serves the minified version of the app in an unbundled state, as it would
be served by a push-compatible server:

    polymer serve build/unbundled
    # Open your browser and navigate to localhost:8080

This command serves the minified version of the app generated using fragment bundling:

    polymer serve build/bundled
    # Open your browser and navigate to localhost:8080

### Run tests

This command will run
[Web Component Tester](https://github.com/Polymer/web-component-tester) against the
browsers currently installed on your machine.

    polymer test

### Adding a new view

You can extend the app by adding more views that will be demand-loaded
e.g. based on the route, or to progressively render non-critical sections
of the application.  Each new demand-loaded fragment should be added to the
list of `fragments` in the included `polymer.json` file.  This will ensure
those components and their dependencies are added to the list of pre-cached
components (and will have bundles created in the fallback `bundled` build).
